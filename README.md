# RLTI Experiment

## Methods

### Block 1

1. Orientation relative to circumference controlled: 48°
2. Randomize line segment length
    1. Selected from levels 1–10 (40 to 220 px in increments of 20)
    2. Each level is shown 3 times
    3. Subject uses a slider (unlabeled, so they don't know exactly what number) to rate illusion strength
3. Statistics
    1. Mean illusion strength of each length
    2. Find the best one (highest mean strength)

### Block 2

1. Line segment length controlled: uses the highest-rated length from block 1
2. Randomize line segment orientation
    1. Selected from levels 1–10 (8 to 80° in increments of 8)
    2. Each level is shown 3 times
    3. Subject uses a slider to rate illusion strength. See Block 1 § 2.3 above.

### Notes

* Duration of trials: 5 s
* Dilation/contraction frequency: 1 Hz
* Inter-stimulus interval for participants to submit their rating
* Optoma HD25 settings: HD, 1080p, 2000 ANSI lumens, 120 Hz projector
* Computer monitor: 60 Hz (approximated; frames are rendered to the nearest millisecond due to delays being multiples of 1 ms)
* Update frequency: 100 Hz
* Receptive field size varies with eccentricity (distance from center).
    * Min length of lines to create effect changes → dependent on radius.
* Controlled variables:
    * Animation speed
    * Stimulus radius (eccentricity)

## Findings

* The illusion is strongest near the inner endpoints of the stimulus; this is due to the smaller receptive field size at lower eccentricities (aperture problem).
* Increasing line length monotonically increases the illusion strength, but at a certain point ($\approx l=200\text{ px}$, the effect begins to plateau.) The increase is due to the aperture effect being possible for more eccentricities (higher radii).
* Increasing angle increases the illusion strength, peaks around $\alpha=30$ to $50$°, then decreases again. The bitonic quality is due to the interaction of two effects: as $\alpha$ increases, the tangential component of the line's velocity increases, increasing illusion strength. However, for higher values of $\alpha$, the stimulus starts to interfere with itself — the lines intersect and overlap, reducing illusion strength.

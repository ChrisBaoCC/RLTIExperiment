Welcome!

This experiment has 5 blocks of 125 trials.
Between blocks, you will be given a short break.

The first block will be made up of practice trials. These are to get you
familiar with various illusion types and strengths. After each animation
plays, you will be given a chance to rate them. However, for the first block,
the ratings will not be recorded.

Each block after that will be experimental trials. Again, the animation will
play and you will rate each. The ratings for these trials will count and
will be recorded.

Thank you for your participation!

About the illusion

The illusion we are exploring here is called the Rotating Tilted Lines
Illusion, or RLTI. As the circle of lines expands and contracts, it may
seem to rotate. You will be rating various illusions on their relative
strengths. A stronger illusion is one with a faster, more noticeable
rotation effect.

While the illusion plays, please keep your eyes on the cross
at the center of the screen.
